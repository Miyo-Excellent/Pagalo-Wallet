# Utils Folder
**Utils folder** contains the helpers, services, UI utils, mixins which are used throughout the application

### Exploring Helpers
In many scenarios, we need to write code multiple times for the same thing like converting the every word first characters to be uppercase usually used in showing titles for any other widgets, etc. This kind of code can be made common to reduce the redundancy and add that code in helpers files which are present in **lib/utils/helpers/text_helper.dart.**
> **Note:** text_helper.dart will contain all the code which are required to convert the String to show in a Text widget.

### Exploring Services
We will be creating a different kind of service files in the folder **lib/utils/services**
> **Note:** All the services will be singleton classes.

1. **local_storage_service.dart:** In this file, we write all the code needed to store and get data from the local storage **[using the plugin shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences).**
In this file, there will be getters and setters for each and every data to be stored in the local storage.

2. **secure_storage_service.dart:** We do not store user credentials, API tokens, secret API keys in local storage, for that we make use of **[flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage)** which stores data in the Android Keystore and Apple keychain with platform-specific encryption technique.
In this file, there will be getters and setters for each and every data to be stored in platform secure storage.

3. **rest_api_service.dart:** We do call the rest API to get, store data on a remote database for that we need to write the rest API call at a single place and need to return the data if the rest call is a success or need to return custom error exception on the basis of 4xx, 5xx status code. We can make use of **[http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)** package to make the rest API call in the flutter

4. **native_api_service.dart:** We use multiple packages to access the native services like Camera, Photo Gallery, Location, etc for that we need to write code in a separate file which we can be used from multiple places throughout the application.

### Exploring Mixins
**Mixin** is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes.‚Äù In other words, mixins are normal classes from which we can borrow methods(or variables) from without extending the class.
In the application, we can make different **mixins** like validation_mixins.dart, orientation_mixins.dart
